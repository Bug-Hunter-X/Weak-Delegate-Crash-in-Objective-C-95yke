The solution involves ensuring that the delegate is properly managed to avoid crashes when the object holding the delegate is deallocated.  One way to improve memory management in this example is to use a strong reference to the delegate if the lifetime of the delegate must outlive the object.

If the lifetime of the delegate should match the object, then the weak reference is fine, but ensure that the method to invoke the delegate safely checks that the delegate still exists.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, weak) id <MyClassDelegate> delegate;

@end

@protocol MyClassDelegate <NSObject>
- (void)myClassDidSomething:(MyClass *)myClass;
@end

@implementation MyClass

- (void)doSomething {
    // ... some code ...
    if (self.delegate && [self.delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(myClassDidSomething:)]) {
        [self.delegate myClassDidSomething:self];
    }
}

- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
}
@end
```
By adding a nil check before calling any methods on the delegate, we prevent potential crashes when the delegate is deallocated.
