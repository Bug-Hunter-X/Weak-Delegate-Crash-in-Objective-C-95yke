This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Objective-C related to memory management and weak delegates.  The `bug.m` file contains code that uses a weak delegate.  Under certain circumstances, this can lead to a crash if the object holding the delegate is deallocated before the delegate is no longer needed. The `bugSolution.m` file provides a solution illustrating the proper handling of weak delegates and memory management to prevent these issues.
